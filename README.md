## About
This map is a purposefully simplified and therefore - inaccurate map of the bounderies of various local authorities and other related geo-political entities within the United Kingdom. The idea is to create a map that can be used on webpages without to much worry about filesize and download times. 

As such, I will except pull requests focusing on any changes to the boundary data - but will refuse any that are simply offering "more" detail, if you require more detail - I suggest you look at the source Boundary-Line data.
